              Way back in 1962, in a one-room office in Campsie, VJ Ray started
              its journey in the Sydney real estate scene. Today, over 55 years
              later, our Strata Team has 27 staff, all with just one goal, to
              help people. VJ Ray is a family company that was started by Leon
              Pollard and is currently owned and operated by his son Mike
              Pollard. The guiding principal behind the VJ Ray culture has been
              to maintain the original family company atmosphere that is so
              often lost as companies grow into corporate giants. At VJ Ray we
              know that our job is much more that just looking after buildings,
              its about caring for and helping the people that own or live in
              those buildings. It's the people that matter. That's why our
              mission statement is so simple. We Help People.
