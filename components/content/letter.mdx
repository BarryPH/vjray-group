Way back in 1962, in a one-room office in Campsie, VJ Ray started its journey in the Sydney real estate scene.

Today, over 55 years later, our Strata Team has 27 staff, all with just one goal, to help people.

VJ Ray is a still a family owned company today.

The guiding principal behind the VJ Ray culture has been to maintain the original family company atmosphere that is so often lost as companies grow into corporate giants.

At VJ Ray we know that our job is much more than just looking after buildings, it’s about caring for and helping the people that own or live in those buildings. It's the people that matter.

That's why our mission statement is so simple.

We Help People.
